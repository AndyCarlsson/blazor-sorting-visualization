# Visualization of Sorting Algorithms

This is a projekt made in serverside Blazor. 

I wanted to explore what kinds of sorting algorithms there were and also learn the basics of the .Net framework Blazor. Killing two birds with one stone I decided to build a visualization of sorting algorithms as a web app in Blazor.
